# Pruning Skeletons

When tracing biological molecules such as DNA using [Atomic Force
Microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy) skeletons often have a side-branches that need
removing to leave the skeleton that represents the backbone of the molecule. Images indicate the height of points in the
x/y plane but are never as clean as one might like. The number of extraneous branches can be reduced by first applying a
Gaussian blur prior to skeletonisation.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%matplotlib inline
%config InlineBackend.figure_format='retina'

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

A sample image showing a loop of DNA is shown below after filtering which involves flattening and removing the inherent
gradient that is present in scans.

```{code-cell} ipython3
raw = np.load("../example-data/sample_grain.npy")
plt.imshow(raw)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.max(raw)
```

The mask for this image is rather messy

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skimage import filters

raw_mask = filters.threshold_li(raw) < raw
plt.imshow(raw_mask)
```

Keeping only the largest component, skeletonizing as-is will give a skeleton with a large number of side branches and internal loops. (We multiply the mask by the raw image to get the height of each point, since this is an AFM image.)

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skimage import morphology
large_comp = morphology.remove_small_objects(raw_mask, min_size=100)
raw_skeleton = morphology.skeletonize(large_comp, method="zhang")
plt.imshow(raw_skeleton * raw)
```

We want to remove all the side-branches which are paths that go from a junction to end-point and we can use the
`.prune_paths()` method to remove such branches, to do this we need to use the `summarize()` function which converts the
skeleton to a graph and classifies each path into one of the following types, as well calculating a number of metrics on
each path.

| Branch Type | Description                            |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| `0`         | endpoint-to-endpoint (isolated branch) |
| `1`         | junction-to-endpoint                   |
| `2`         | junction-to-junction                   |
| `3`         | isolated cycle                         |

```{code-cell} ipython3
import skan
from skan import Skeleton

height_skeleton = raw_skeleton * raw
# Summarise the skeleton
skeleton = Skeleton(height_skeleton, keep_images=True, value_is_height=True)  # TODO: include pixel spacing
skeleton_summary = skan.summarize(skeleton, separator='-')
# Extract the indices of paths of type
junction_to_endpoint = skeleton_summary[skeleton_summary["branch-type"] == 1].index
skeleton_pruned = skeleton.prune_paths(junction_to_endpoint).skeleton_image
plt.imshow(skeleton_pruned)
```

However because some of the branches have branches themselves which were not removed since they dodn't terminate in an
end-point. Further we observe some small loops that also need removing.

## Iteratively Prune Paths

To address this issue the `iteratively_prune_paths()` function can be used to repeatedly prune skeletons until only a
single path remains, whether that is circular or linear. However, this function needs the skeleton in another format,
a networkx MultiGraph, because the native data structures in skan are not easy to update repeatedly. We use the `skeleton_to_nx`
function for this.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skan.csr import skeleton_to_nx  # TODO: update to just skan
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nxskel = skeleton_to_nx(skeleton, skeleton_summary)
```

Now, we can use the iteratively_prune_paths function. This function takes in the graph, and a *discard* predicate, a function that takes as input the graph and an edge ID, and returns True if that edge should be removed. To create a useful predicate, it's good to know what attributes an edge has, which we can do by inspecting an arbitrary edge in our graph. Note the keywords `data=True`, which returns the full data on each edge, and `keys=True`, which returns, in addition to the edge source and target, a *key* for each edge, which distinguishes edges when there are multiple edges between two nodes.

```{code-cell} ipython3
next(iter(nxskel.edges(keys=True, data=True)))
```

In short, it has every attribute in the summary table, as well as the path coordinates (in pixel space), the nonzero pixel indices, and the image values under the array.

Now, looking at the above skeleton, we notice:
- single branches that haven't been removed (because the original pruning function wasn't iterative/recursive
- small self-loops that aren't removed because they aren't technically endpoints
- dual loops where one of two paths joining points is "dimmer" than the other

+++

Let's look at the signature of `iteratively_prune_paths`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skan import iteratively_prune_paths
help(iteratively_prune_paths)
```

So we need to write a function that will identify the edges that we don't want in the graph. To repeat our previous conditions:

- edge branches â€” one of the endpoints' degrees should be 1.
- self-loops *other* than the final self-loop, which of course we want to keep! ðŸ˜…
- the "dimmer" edge of a multi-edge pair.

Let's try:

```{code-cell} ipython3
def unwanted(mg, e):
    u, v, k = e
    # first the easy one: the branch is an endpoint
    if mg.degree(u) == 1 or mg.degree(v) == 1:
        return True
    # next, self-loops, other than the final self-loop
    if u == v and len(mg.edges()) > 1:
        return True
    # finally, the dimmer of two of the same edge.
    # We'll use a helper function, 'get_multiedge', that returns
    # a sibling multiedge if it exists and None otherwise
    if (e2 := get_multiedge(mg, e)) is not None:
        # if there is a multiedge, we discard current edge if it's
        # dimmer (lower mean pixel value) than its sibling edge
        return mg.edges[e]['mean_pixel_value'] < mg.edges[e2]['mean_pixel_value']
    return False


def get_multiedge(mg, e):
    u, v, k = e
    edge_keys = set(mg[u][v])  # g[u][v] returns a view of the keys
    if len(edge_keys) > 1:  # multiedge
        other_key = (edge_keys - {k}).pop()
        return (u, v, other_key)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
skeletons_pruned_iteratively = list(iteratively_prune_paths(nxskel, discard=unwanted))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
images = np.asarray([sk.skeleton_image for sk in skeletons_pruned_iteratively])
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
def pts_list_to_nd(list_of_coord_arrays):
    arrs = []
    for i, arr in enumerate(list_of_coord_arrays):
        prefix = np.full((arr.shape[0], 1), i)
        arrs.append(np.concatenate((prefix, arr), axis=1))
    return np.concatenate(arrs, axis=0)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skan import summarize

summaries = [summarize(sk, separator='_') for sk in skeletons_pruned_iteratively]
src_pts = [np.asarray(s[['image_coord_src_0', 'image_coord_src_1']]) for s in summaries]
src_pts_nd = pts_list_to_nd(src_pts)
dst_pts = [np.asarray(s[['image_coord_dst_0', 'image_coord_dst_1']]) for s in summaries]
dst_pts_nd = pts_list_to_nd(dst_pts)

all_pts = np.concatenate([src_pts_nd, dst_pts_nd], axis=0)
all_pts_unique = np.unique(all_pts, axis=0)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
viewer, layer = napari.imshow(images)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pts_layer = viewer.add_points(all_pts_unique, size=1, face_color='red')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
skel0 = skeletons_pruned_iteratively[0]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
all_paths = [skel0.path_coordinates(i) for i in range(skel0.n_paths)]
paths_table = summaries[0]
paths_table['path_id'] = np.arange(skel0.n_paths)
paths_table['random_path_id'] = np.random.default_rng().permutation(skel0.n_paths)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
len(np.unique(paths_table['random_path_id']))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
skel0.n_paths
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
skeleton_layer = viewer.add_shapes(
        all_paths,
        shape_type='path',
        features=paths_table,
        edge_width=0.5,
        edge_color='random_path_id',
        edge_colormap='tab10',
        )
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
skeleton_layer.edge_color_cycle = 'tab10'
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
len(skeleton_pruned_iteratively.nodes())
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
len(skeleton_pruned_iteratively.edges())
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skan.csr import nx_to_skeleton

skel_pruned2 = nx_to_skeleton(skeleton_pruned_iteratively)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.imshow(skeleton_pruned_iteratively.skeleton_image)
```

This has worked fairly well, it has removed all the side branches and small loops but there are a number of internal
loops that remain. This is because we started with a noisy/messy mask to derive the skeleton, but we can improve on
that.

## Gaussian Blurring

If we apply a [Gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur) to the raw image before skeletonising we
obtain a much clearer mask.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from skimage import filters

raw_smoothed = filters.gaussian(raw, sigma=3)
plt.imshow(raw_smoothed)
```

To get a binary mask we use [Otsu Thresholding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method) to find a threshold above
which points are considered part of the image and below which they are not.

```{code-cell} ipython3
mask_smoothed = raw_smoothed >= filters.threshold_otsu(raw_smoothed)
plt.imshow(mask_smoothed)
```

This already looks a lot cleaner, when we skeletonise the image we now have far less side-branches and loops.

```{code-cell} ipython3
skeleton_smoothed = morphology.skeletonize(mask_smoothed, method="zhang")
plt.imshow(skeleton_smoothed)
```

In this instance the Gaussian blurring has been so effective we only have a single branch to prune and there are no
internal loops, but we will use the `iteratively_prune_paths()` function to tidy this up

```{code-cell} ipython3
skeleton_smoothed_pruned_iteratively = iteratively_prune_paths(skeleton).skeleton_image
plt.imshow(skeleton_smoothed_pruned_iteratively)
```

We now have a single path for the skeleton which represents the loop of DNA.
